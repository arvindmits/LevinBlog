## Intro

<br />

<strong>This is one guide in a series of guides that can act as study material for Microsoft's new Azure oriented certification exams.</strong>

* [AZ-301 Exam Guide](/post/az-301-study-guide)

<br />

The AZ-300 exam, which is titled "Azure Solutions Architect Expert" and has a target audience of Azure Solution Architects. This exam was in beta for some time and was recently released proper in January 2019. Architects used to the Microsoft certification world will see this exam as a replacement for 70-535, which is the older iteration of Azure technology geared for architects. Passing this exam is one requirement to earn the "Microsoft Certified Azure Solutions Architect Expert" certification, the other being AZ-301. Going forward, most Microsoft certifications are moving to a [job-role based](https://buildazure.com/2018/09/24/introducing-role-based-microsoft-azure-certification-shakeup/) (great take by Chris Pietschmann at Build Azure) approach, which in my opinion is a good move, as it allows folks to focus on passing exams that contain content that will directly be used on the job. For more information about the exam, take a look at the [Official Exam Page](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-AZ-300.aspx)

## Skills Measured


<br />
Hereâ€™s a high level list of the skills and objectives measured on the AZ-300 Azure Solutions Architect Expert certification exam. The percentages next to each objective area represents the number of questions in that objective area on the exam.
