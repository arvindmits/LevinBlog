## [Application Insights, The Tool You Never Knew You Needed](https://github.com/isaac2004/levin-talks/raw/master/AppInsights/AppInsightsPresentation.pptx)

Understanding how our applications function in the wild is essential for developers when issues arise. With the power of knowledge, we can enable ourselves to provide the best experience to our fellow developers, and our stakeholders. One of the solutions that supplies this power is Application Insights. Application Insights is a service provided by Microsoft allowing you to monitor your application live, detect performance anomalies, and observe this data with powerful analytics. Together we will see how easy it is to add Application Insights to our applications, whether we have access to the code-base or not. Once instrumented, we will dive deeper into the capabilities of Application Insights and show how to leverage all the rich data collected from our application. Finally, as developers the last thing we want to do is troubleshoot an issue in Production, with everyone watching and the stakes are high. Watch as we monitor a live application that is throwing exceptions and how Application Insights can be used to help us solve the problem faster. When we are done, attendees will be empowered with the knowledge to leverage Application Insights to be more productive with their work.

## Ship It Good, Deploying ASP.NET Core Like a Pro

Do you write web apps using ASP.NET Core? When it comes time to deploy your app, how do you do it? Do you use Visual Studio, or maybe you are fancy and use some CI/CD process. Regardless of what mechanism you use to deploy, what are you deploying? There are many things to consider when we deploy our ASP.NET Core apps but sometimes, we as developers don't pay attention.
<br /><br />
In this session, we will learn all the different ways we can deploy our apps and how we can find the perfect solution that works for your needs. Using Azure Pipelines, CLIs, and yes, Visual Studio, we will deploy an application to Azure in different scenarios.

<div id="core3" class="mt4"></div>

## What to Expect When You Are Expecting ASP.NET Core 3.0

As the world eagerly awaits (pun intended) the release of .NET Core 3.0, developers see great stories about how the desktop client will be revolutionized by it being brought into Core. Some people may see that as the web being left out, but that is not the case at all.
<br /><br />
ASP.NET Core 3.0 will include many additions that further expands the capabilities of the platform with enhancements and new features entirely. These additions will bring many wonderful things, but it also important to understand how our apps will need to change. Join a demo-filled ride through what you can expect from ASP.NET Core 3.0

## [Building Your Own YouTube, sortof](https://github.com/isaac2004/levin-talks/raw/master/MediaServices/Azure%20Media%20Services.pptx)

<br />
Azure Media Services allows an organization to enhance accessibility, distribution, and scalability for video content. By leveraging Media Services, developers have the ability to develop feature rich solutions for video content management. This session will demonstrate the ease to upload and process videos using Azure Functions and Azure Media Services, and deliver these videos in a way where they are view able on the web using Azure Media Player. We will also take a look at leveraging Cognitive Services to enable AI on our Media and seeing the rich insights from it.

 <div id="4cli" class="mt4"></div>

## [How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the CLI](https://github.com/isaac2004/levin-talks/raw/master/Clis/The%20Four%20CLIs%20of%20The%20Apocalypse.pptx)

In the dark, dystopian land of Web Development, it is hard to navigate the most productive way to build and deploy our applications. May I present an opinionated approach to developing web applications in the new world. Command-line interfaces are as old as time, so why would any sane person reccommend using a handful of them in the modern application development space? The answer is ease of use. During this session, we will use the power of the command line, with some help of Visual Studio Code, to create, develop, build and deploy an application to the cloud. Here is how we are going to accomplish this.
<br /><br />
Using Git Bash, Angular CLI, .NET CLI, and the Azure CLI, we will build 2 separate apps, connect them, commit them to a code repository and deploy to the cloud. All with little need to be in an editor at all. Beware attending this presentation may leave you with urges to forgot about GUIs completely.

## [How To Work From Home Without Living At Work](https://github.com/isaac2004/levin-talks/raw/master/WorkFromHome/WorkFromHomePresentation.pptx)

In the ever-changing world of talent hiring, perks are king. To lure the best and the brightest to join their firms, more and more companies are giving their employees the option to work from home. This allows the individual to better control the their work-life balance. Though it sounds amazing at first, over time your professional responsibility can drift into your home life; causing issues around work/life balance. Every person that works from home takes the risk of working more - and more. Likely without even realizing it, like I did. My work from home story has highs and lows, and sharing where I have been successful as well as unsuccessful can help anyone considering the option. I have also had the opportunity to speak with colleagues who work from home as well, and I want to share what I have learned.
<br /><br />
With these exciting opportunities, it is important to declare early on what your priorities are; and how you can ensure you meet those priorities. After this discussion, people who attend this talk will have a new understanding of how people who work from home can be successful.
